# Rust Project

## Overview
This is a Rust project that can be built and run using Cargo. This guide provides instructions on how to set up, build, and run the project on both Windows and macOS.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Git (optional, if cloning from a repository)

### Installing Rust and Cargo
Rust comes with `cargo`, the Rust package manager and build system. You can install Rust and Cargo using `rustup`:

#### Windows
1. Download and run the installer from [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Rust.
3. Restart your terminal and verify the installation:
   ```sh
   rustc --version
   cargo --version
   ```

#### macOS
1. Open a terminal and run:
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
2. Follow the installation prompts.
3. Restart your terminal and verify the installation:
   ```sh
   rustc --version
   cargo --version
   ```

## Cloning the Project
If you are using Git, clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
```
Alternatively, you can download and extract the project zip file.

## Building the Project
Once inside the project directory, build the project using Cargo:
```sh
cargo build
```
This will compile the project and place the output in the `target/debug/` directory.

To build in release mode for optimized performance, use:
```sh
cargo build --release
```
The output will be located in `target/release/`.

## Running the Project
Run the project using:
```sh
cargo run
```
Or, if you built it in release mode:
```sh
target/release/your_project_name
```

## Running Tests
Run the tests with:
```sh
cargo test
```

## Formatting Code
Ensure the code follows Rust formatting standards by running:
```sh
cargo fmt
```

## Linting
Check for common issues in the code using:
```sh
cargo clippy
```
